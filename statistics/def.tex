Statistics is a field of mathematics that pertains to data analysis. Statistical methods and equations can be applied to a data set in order to analyze and interpret results, explain variations in the data, or predict future dara.

Two important concepts in Statistics are \textbf{population} and \textbf{sample}. Population is all the data available, the larger group. Sample is a subset of the population, a fraction or portion of the total data available.
