The mean, also known as the \textbf{average}, is obtained by dividing the sum of observed values, data values $x_i$, by the number of observations, $n$.

\[
  \bar{X} = \dfrac{1}{n} \mathlarger{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i}
\]

Equation xxx can be used when the error associated with each measurement is the same or unknown.
