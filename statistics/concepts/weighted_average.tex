Also known as \textbf{weighted mean} or \textbf{weighted arithmetic mean}. The weighted average gives more importance to certain data points by multiplying each value a specific weight before summing them up. The result is then divided by the sum of the weights to find the average. This method is used when data have different levels of importance or significance.
