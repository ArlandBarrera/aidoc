The variance squares the spread of each data point, this raises a problem. The measure of units of the data set is lost because it has been squared. To solve this problem the square root of the variance can found, that way the measure of the original data is more close. This is known as standard deviation.

The standard deviation gives an idea of how close the entire set of data is to the average value. Data sets with a small standard deviation have tightly grouped, precise data. Data sets with large standard deviations have data spread out over a wide range of values.

The \textbf{sample standard deviation} is represented by the letter $s$.

\begin{listequbox}
  {s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{X})^2 }}{equstddevsmp}{Sample standard deviation}
\end{listequbox}

The \textbf{population standard deviation} is represented by the greek letter $\sigma$.

\begin{listequbox}
  {\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N (x_i-\mu)^2 }}{equstddevpop}{Population standard deviation}
\end{listequbox}
