Artificial intelligence algorithms can be classified by their learning approach, task type, domain, and others.

\textbf{Learning approach}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Supervised learning.
  \item Unsupervised learning.
  \item Reinforcement learning.
  \item Semi-supervised learning.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Task type}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Classification: used to sort data into categories.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Binary classification: separates data into two classes.
      \item Multi-class classification: assigns an item to three or more classes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Regression: used to predict a continuous value.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Domain}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Natural Language Procesing (NLP).
  \item Computer vision.
\end{itemize}
