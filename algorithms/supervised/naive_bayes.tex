The Naive Bayes algorithm in machine learning is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem that makes a "\textit{naive}" assumption that all features are independent of each other given the class. It calculates the probability of a class given a set of features, using the formula shown below.

\begin{listequbox}
  {P(\text{class}|\text{data}) = \dfrac{P(\text{data}|\text{class})P(\text{class})}{P(\text{data})}}{equbavbay}{Naive Bayes theorem}
\end{listequbox}

The independence assumption simplifies the calculation.
